# Hi, I'm Sam.

I'm a software engineer.
I write about coding, tech, history, politics, and whatever I'm interested in at the moment. During my free time, I knit / crochet, bike, 
shitpost on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samwightt), and learn / try new things.

## Experience

I've worked in both frontend and full-stack development and am comfortable with both. I'm very comfortable with TypeScript / JavaScript,
Node, Ruby, and Elixir.

I'm proficient in these frontend frameworks:

- React
- Svelte
- Solid
- (Some experience in Vue)

and I'm proficient in these backend frameworks:

- Ruby on Rails
- Phoenix / Plug
- Express

I've been programming since I was 11. I started programming professionally in 2018 with my first internship / contract position,
and have done various internships and part-time positions since.

For my full professional history, [see my Polywork](https://timeline.samw.dev/).
