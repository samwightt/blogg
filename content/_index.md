# Hi, I'm Sam.

I'm a computer science student at The University of Alabama and a software engineer at [Procurated](https://procurated.com).
I write about coding, tech, history, politics, and whatever I'm interested in at the moment. During my free time, I knit / crochet,
shitpost on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samwightt), and learn / try new things.

## Experience

I'm a frontend engineer, but I'm comfortable working across the entire stack. I'm very comfortable with TypeScript / JavaScript,
Node, and Elixir. I'm currently working on writing a book about TypeScript.

I'm proficient in these frontend frameworks:

- React
- Svelte
- Solid

and I'm proficient in these backend frameworks:

- Phoenix / Plug
- Express
- Fastify

I've been programming since I was 11. I started programming professionally in 2018 with my first internship / contract position,
and have done various internships and part-time positions since. Most recently, I started work as a software engineer at [Procurated](https://procurated.com/).
